                            <br />And in one, we print it with the last name first.

                            This program will ask to enter a number in bytes, then it will work out how many kilobytes, megabytes and gigabytes that it is.
                            <br />Be sure to look at the console below to see what I mean.
                            <br />Once you've done that, make to go from gigabytes to megabytes, kilabytes and bytes.
                            <br />To go from bytes to kilobytes, kilobytes to megabytes etc., divide by 1024 (or just 1000 to keep it simple).
                            <br />
                            <br />To go from megabytes to kilobytes, kilobytes to bytes etc., multiply by 1024.

                            OK, so, we have a variable for each thing - the bits (as part of the extension), the bytes, the kilobytes the megabytes and the gigabytes, and, we'll just reuse these multiple times.
                            <br />OK, so, first we'll do the "bytes to kilobytes" one - of course, asking them to enter the number of bytes.
                            <br />So, first, I'll calculate all of them, then I'll print them to the screen - we're dividing each of them by 1024 at each stage.
                            <br />So, first we calculate the kilobytes, then we use that kilobytes variable to calculate the megabytes and we use that variable to calculate the gigabytes.
                            <br />Then, I'll print all of them to the screen.
                            <br />
                            <br />OK, now, for the gigabytes to bytes, it's the same but with multiplying by 1024 instead.
                            <br />
                            <br />And, on the "bits" one, we just multiply the "bits" they entered by "8", then put that into the bytes variable, and from that point it's all the same.

                            Make a program that will input your height (in m) and weight (in kg), and calculate your BMI.
                            <br />To calculate your BMI, just divide the weight by the height squared (weight / height²)
                            <br />To do a squared, you can just do the height multiplied by itself (height * height);
                            <br />Remember your brackets - you want to work out the square of "height" first - then divide weight by that!

                        <p>
                            First, let's define all of our variables - we're going to create a "weight" and "height", then we're going to create a "bmiAnswer", which is where our final calculation will go.
                            <br />We're going to re-use "weight" and "height" twice (because of the extension), because there's no need to make any extra variables.
                            <br />Next, we'll ask them to enter their weight and height, of course.
                            <br />Then, we calculate it. We have the "height * height" in brackets because we want to work that out <i>first</i>, and <i>then</i> divide the weight by it. And, then, we print out the result, and we print it out with the calculation
                            it was doing.
                            <br />
                            <br />

                            <b>EXTENSION</b>
                            Now, we do the extension. So, we ask them for their height and weight again.
                            <br />But, now, when we calculate, we multiply the entire thing by "703".
                            <br />We've put the calculation in brackets, because that means it will work that out first - so, this is how it would calculate if "weight" was 6 and "height" was 3:
                            <br />

                            <code>703 * (6 / (3 * 3))</code>
                            <br />
                            <code>703 * (6 / 9)</code>
                            <br />
                            <code>703 * 0.66...</code>
                            <br />

                        <h1>Grade Calculator</h1>
                        <p>
                            Right, then let's make a fake little grade calculator. So, you give the program a percentage, and it will say whether that's an "A*, A, B, C, D etc."
                            <br>These are the numbers we will be using:
                            <br>
                            <code>91 - 100% = A*</code>
                            <br>
                            <code>81 - 90% = A</code>
                            <br>
                            <code>71 - 80% = B</code>
                            <br>
                            <code>61 - 70% = C</code>
                            <br>
                            <code>51 - 60% = D</code>
                            <br>
                            <code>Below 50% = E</code>
                            <br>
                            <br>Use integers - not floats for this one.
                            <br>
                            <br>

                            <b>IMPORTANT TIP</b>
                            <br>You have to use "else if" on this one. Because if you say something like <code>if (percentage &gt; 90)</code> and then later on say <code>if (percentage &gt; 80)</code>, then it will run both of them.
                            <br>So, in that scenario, if you got "96%", the first if statement would run, because your percentage is higher than "91", it will run that first "if" statement, and your grade will be "A*", but, then because all the others will
                            also run, that "A*" would be overwritten with an "D" by the <code>if (percentage &gt; 50)</code>.
                            <br>
                            <br>However, if you did <code>if (percentage &gt; 90)</code>, followed by <code>else if (percentage &gt; 80)</code>, then it won't run that second if, if the percentage was above 91, so that doesn't happen.
                            <br>So, use "else if"s.

                                If you got "0%", you could try to get it to output "U" - it's actually a little more tricky than you might think.

                            OK, let's extend our calculator from before, so, it will still ask you to enter two numbers, but, then, at the end, it will ask you what kind of calculation you want to do.
                            <br />So, it asks me to enter to two numbers, but, then it will ask me if I want to do addition (by typing a "+"), subtracting (by typing a "-"), multiplication (by typing a "*") or division (by typing a "/").
                            <br>Once you've chosen, the program will then do that kind of calculation.
                            <br />
                            <br />So, if I enter "14" and "17" and then type "*", it will do "14 * 17". Look at the console below to see how it should work.

                            Right, now, in this program, we'll have the firstNumber, secondNumber, calculation and answer stored in variables.
                            <br>The "calculation" variable will store what calculation they enter when they are asked to choose either "+", "-", "*" or "/"
                            <br>So, we'll ask them for the first and second numbers first, of course.
                            <br>Then, we'll ask them for what calculation they want to do. Then this is where the selection comes in.
                            <br>
                            <br>So, if they typed "+", then we'll add the two numbers and put that into the "answer" variable.
                            <br>If they typed "-", then we'll subtract the two numbers and put that into the "answer" variable.
                            <br>And so on.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>We're using "else if" here, but it would technically work with just "if" statements as well, if you used those.</b> 
                            <br>
                            <br>Then, we print the result out - now, this is actually really simple. Since, we stored what calculation they wanted to do in the "calculation" variable, we just print that out.
                            <br>That <code>+ " " +</code> is actually adding a space because there's a space in-between those quotes, it is joining a space in, so that's what that's for.

                            So, first we input the two strings - that's pretty easy and simple.
                            <br>Then we have some if statements here - so, first we check if they are both the same length, if so we output that.
                            <br>Next, we ask if the first string is bigger than the second string, and if so, we say that it is bigger.
                            <br>As a part of the extension, we also calculate by how much, simply by subtracting the length of it from the other string's length.
                            <br>And, we do the same for the second string as well.
                            <br>And that's it!

                            <br />And, if it's both, write "FizzBuzz" all in one word.

                            This program will add as many numbers as you want together... Make sure to look at the console for this one.
                            <br />So, first, the program asks the user how many numbers they want to add together.
                            <br>Then, it ask them to enter all of those numbers.
                            <br />Then it outputs all of those numbers added together.
                            <br>If you really really get stuck, you can look at the answer - but make sure you definitely understand how it's done in the answer before moving on.
                            <br /><b>TIP: The simplest way of doing this is: Inside the loop, everytime they enter a number, it adds that number to a "total" variable - so, something like "total = total + numberEntered".</b>

                                Make it so the whole program loops, so, once they get to the end it goes back to the beginning.

                            So, in this, we create a variable called "total" - everytime the user enters another number, it will add to the thing.
                            <br>Then, we, of course, actually ask them to input how many numbers they want to add together.
                            <br>After that, we use a "for" loop in order to go enter a specific amount of number - so, if "numberOfNumbersToAdd" is "3", the code inside the for loop will run 3 times - if it's 4, the code inside the for loop will run 4 times.
                            <br>Then, we ask them to enter that number, and we take the number they entered, and add it to the total - so, if total was "5", and they entered "3", it will become "8"
                            <br>And, finally, we output the total at the end!
                            <br>Oh, and, for the extension, we wrap the whole thing in a "while (true)", so it will never end unless you press the close button.

                            Make a program that recieves an <i>integer</i> array from the user, and goes through every single item in an array, and finds the largest number in it.
                            <br>To do this, make a variable called "biggestNumber" that starts off as "0".
                            <br>Then, check each item (in a loop) and see if it's bigger than the "biggestNumber" variable.
                            <br>If it <i>is</i> bigger than the "biggestNumber" variable, then set the "biggestNumber" to <i>that</i> item, otherwise, don't do anything.
                            <br>Then, simply output what "biggestNumber" is after the whole loop, and it will tell you which number was the biggest!

                            <br>If an item is bigger, we set the "biggestNumber" to that item in the array instead.

                        <p>
                            Alright, this is a bit of a maths one!
                            <br>Imagine you have a table with three columns - you've got "f", "x" and "fx".
                            <br>What happens is the third column, "fx" is "f" multiplied by "x"... Take a look at the table below to get an idea of what's going on here.

                            <table>
                                <tr>
                                    <th>f</th>
                                    <th>x</th>
                                    <th>fx</th>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>2</td>
                                    <td>5</td>
                                    <td>10</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>6</td>
                                    <td>4</td>
                                    <td>24</td>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>5</td>
                                    <td>9</td>
                                    <td>45</td>
                                </tr>
                            </table>

                            <br>The task is to make a program that will take in all of the "f"s and all of the "x"s, and work out the "fx"s.
                            <br>
                            <br>Take a look at the console for a good demo of how this program should work!
                            <br>
                            <br>Technically, if you were just showing the results straight away as they entered the values, this wouldn't need arrays, but, because we're showing the results <b>after</b> they've entered all the values in, we have to remember
                            what all of the "f"s and "x"s are.

                            <br><b>NOTE: You will need TWO integer arrays for this one - one will hold all of the "f"s, and the other will hold all of the "x"s.</b>

                            <br>
                            <br>So, initialize the two arrays to the correct size, then use one "for" loop to input all the "f"s and "x"s, then, after that "for" loop another loop that will work out the "fx"s from those values in the arrays and print them
                            out.

                        <p>
                            <b>NOTE: This one is quite a challenge and quite a long one too, but definitely worth it!</b>
                            <br>One thing you can calculate in maths is something called the <b>standard deviation</b>, and it's a very long and time-consuming thing to calculate - so, we're going to write a program to calculate it for us!

                            <br>
                            <br>So, we can take a <b>list of any amount of numbers</b> and calculate the standard deviation of them, what the standard deviation is, is essentially an average of how far away from the mean all of the items are, it gives us a
                            good idea of if the data is "skewed" in a certain direction.

                            <br>
                            <br>Alright, here's how to calculate it:

                            <br>
                            <br>1. Take in all the numbers of course, as you can see in the console, you say how many items you want to enter, and just enter them.
                            <br>
                            <br>2. <b>Work out the mean of all of the numbers</b>, how to work out the mean is below.
                            <br>
                            <br>3. We need to get the <i>sum</i> of all of the items squared. So, <b>go through every item, square them (by multiplying them by themselves), then add them to some sort of total</b> - it's exactly like with the "mean", except you
                            square each item before adding them to the total.
                            <br>
                            <br>4. Take <i>that</i> total we just got and <b>divide that by the total number of items</b>, exactly like we would with the mean. Just like with the mean, put this into a <b>double</b> variable.
                            <br>
                            <br>5. We take the number we just calculated and subtract it from the mean <i>squared</i>. <b>So, it will look something like this: lastNumber - (mean * mean)</b>, <b>put this into a double too</b>
                            <br>
                            <br>6. Finally, we take that number we just got and <b>work out the square root of it, that's your final answer</b>, the square root of that number. NOTE: To work out the square root, use "variable = Math.Sqrt(number)", putting
                            the number you want to square root inside place of the "number", of course.
                            <br><b>NOTE: "Math.Sqrt" gives back a double, and takes in a double, so put it into a "double" variable, and make sure to give it a double too.</b>

                            <br>
                            <br>How to work out the mean:

                            <br>1. Create a "total" variable.
                            <br>2. Take all of items and add them up, into some kind of "total" variable, to do that go through each item, and within the "for" loop, for each item, just add it to the total using "+=". <b>This will need to go into a "double"!</b>
                            <br>3. Finally, take that "total" and divide it by the number of items there are.

                            <br>
                            <br>What is a double?
                            <br><b>A double is just a more accurate "float". Floats are 32-bits, while a double is 64-bits, so you can get more decimal places in a double</b>

                            <br>
                            <br>If you've done something wrong - you will probably get "NaN" as your final answer, check through your code carefully.
                            <br>To check if you did it right, just enter in some numbers into the console, and enter the same numbers into your program, and you should get the same result!

                            Imagine this program is used at the entrance of some place where a show is being put on. This program will let the user check if someone is allowed in.
                            <br>Before the show, the user can enter a list of names (they say how many names first, so use an array, not a list).
                            <br>Once they've entered in all of the names, the program will then enter into a mode that lets someone check if someone is on the list.
                            <br>This will happen infinitely, as you can see in the console.
                            <br>Don't worry about removing people after they've entered.
                            <br><br><b>NOTE: Remember to turn the names into lower case! Either as they get entered into the array, or when you're checking the names, you would do that using <code>something.ToLower()</code></b>
                            <br><br>To do this, whenever someone enters a name, you need to use the linear searching method I made in Episode 15 to look through the list of names we made at the start and see if that person is in that array. 
                            <br><br>So, you would do something like this: <code>bool isMember = IsInArray(arr, theText);</code>, then you can just say something along the lines of <code>if (isMember == true) Console.WriteLine("You're allowed in!"); </code>, and within an "else" it will reject that person.
                            <br>Remember to <b>debug</b> if it doesn't work.
                            <br><br>It's OK to struggle with these tasks - <b>you may even need to re-watch the video to remind yourself of things!</b>

                                Make a VIP array AND a regular members array. 
                                <br><br>Then, when you're checking their names, say whether they're a VIP, a regular member or just not on any lists.
                                <br><br>This would be done by checking through both the VIP list and the regular members list.
                                <br><br><b>NOTE: People can't be on both the VIP list <i>and</i> the regular members list, so it's best to check if they're on the VIP list first, and only if they aren't do you <i>then</i> check to see if they're a regular member.</b>
                                <br><br>Once you've done all this, take your final program and split it all up into smaller methods to keep it neater.

                                public List&lt;int&gt; FindAllMatchesInArray(string[] arr, string toFind) { }

                            <br><br>For example, if we have pass in an array like this as the first parameter:

                            <table>
                                <tr>

                                    <th>1</th>
                                    <th>2</th>
                                    <th>3</th>
                                    <th>4</th>
                                </tr>
                                <tr>
                                    <td>"ABC"</td>
                                    <td>"DE"</td>
                                    <td>"GLK"</td>
                                    <td>"DE"</td>

                            </table>

                            And we pass "DE" as the second parameter, <i>the thing we need to find in the array</i>, then it should give us <code>1, 3, 4</code> in that "List" it returns. Because it found "DE" in positions 1, 3 and 4 in the array.
                            <br><br>To do this, make a list inside the method (like at the top), this will be what you return. Then, go through each item in the "arr" and if it matches the "toFind", add whatever "i" is to the list, to remember what position that item was at.
                            <br><br>And return the list!
